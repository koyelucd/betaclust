Description: A family of novel beta mixture models is proposed based on model-based
  clustering approach to identify the different methylation profiles and the DMRs 
  between different samples by modelling the samples together in a mixture model. 
  The code has been optimized by using parallel programming throughout and 
  digamma function approximation at M-step which has reduced run-time considerable.

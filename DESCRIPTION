Description: A family of novel beta mixture models (BMMs) to appositely model beta valued DNA methylation data, to objectively identify methylation state thresholds and to identify the differentially methylated CpG (DMC) sites using a model-based clustering approach. The family of BMMs employs different parameter constraints applicable to different study settings. Parameter estimation proceeds via the EM algorithm, with a novel approximation during the M-step providing tractability and ensuring computational feasibility.
